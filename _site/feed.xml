        <title>How Does Caffeine work?</title>
        <description>
          
          How does Caffeine work? Caffeine is a new internet protocol for app network traffic. We&#39;ve taken HTTP, TLS, and TCP, and re-engineered them into a tightly integrated and faster networking stack. We send the same data you do today, just with less overhead. So if you&#39;re already doing compression and...

        <title>Caffeine&#39;s Effect on a CDN-Hosted Image</title>
        <description>
          
          The Effect of Caffeine on a CDNâ€™s image We show that delivering an image from Washington D.C. to Austin, TX using Caffeine (1523.8 miles) is far faster than delivering an image from Dallas to Austin using HTTPS (195.1 miles) on a 3G connection. This experiment measures the use of Fastly...

        <title>A Performance Breakthrough on Small File Transfers</title>
        <description>
          
          A performance breakthrough on small file transfers (Codename: LOWTIDE) While testing Nitrogen, the protocol within Caffeine, using small files (&amp;lt;2mb) we discovered peculiar behavior that soon launched an investigation and a subsequent performance breakthrough. Internally, we had conflict. One team thought that Caffeine was going as fast as it could,...

        <title>Response Times vs. Payload Size</title>
        <description>
          
          How does the performance of Caffeine degrade as the payload size becomes larger? We compare the response times of downloading increasingly large files using both Caffeine and HTTP. In Atlanta, Georgia, we put a server hosting 20 files incrementing in size by 200kb starting at 200kb and going to 4mb....

        <title>Analyzing download-times of images with and without Caffeine</title>
        <description>
          
          Caffeine reduces network latency in native iOS applications. (PDF) This document empirically discusses the following two items: The amount of latency reduced Characterization of latency reduction Abstract We collocate a server in Switzerland (to show extreme distance) and repeatedly download images from it using an iOS Simulator in Cambridge, MA....
